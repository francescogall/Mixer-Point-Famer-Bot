"# Mixer-Point-Famer-Bot" 

This script allows you to farm Mixer Points on Paladins. The script allows users to leave their laptop farm points while they are away. Simply start the script, click on the chat window and press F3. F2 will make the script pause. If the user wants to change messages, simply open up "chatmsg.txt" and add/edit/remove sentences divided by "|".

Modifying timers allows anti-spam bots and moderators to not detect you using the bot. Currently using around 120 seconds. Minimum is 27 seconds based on chat rules.
